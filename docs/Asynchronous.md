# Asynchronous, Non-Blocking

For further consideration of additional asynchronous process
WebFlux, Reactive Redis, and R2DBC can optimize performance with asynchronous and non-blocking methods.

Why
* Using WebFlux alone can result in bottlenecks for database and cache access. 
* Reactive Redis and R2DBC can be processed asynchronously to maintain low-latency responses and high performance.

pros:
* WebFlux handles asynchronous processing to efficiently manage concurrent requests 
* Reactive Redis processes communication with Redis asynchronously
* R2DBC asynchronously handles database I/O

cons:
* Learning Curve: It may have a steeper learning curve if you're not familiar with it.
* Difficult Debugging: Debugging asynchronous code can be challenging.
* Resource Management: Without careful management of asynchronous connections, there is a risk of resource leakage
